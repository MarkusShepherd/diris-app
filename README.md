# Diris #

A mobile adaptation of the popular board game [Dixit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixit_(card_game)). Players submit photos either from their camera, from their gallery, or from a selection of publicly available images.

## Setup ##

First, install [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/). Then:

```bash
git clone git@bitbucket.org:MarkusShepherd/diris-app.git
cd diris-app
phonegap prepare
phonegap serve
```
In the terminal you should see a URL. Navigate to that URL in the browser, or use it in the Phonegap developer app.
